# China novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) and the stupefyingly soothing effect of statistics modelling

Disclaimer: I am not an expert on this topic, nor was I less shocked and unprepared by the coronavirus epidemic than anyone else. I am at best a concerned citizen with some background in math. My aim is to draw the potential reader's attention to the current virus outbreak. I try at all my powers to avoid conceptual or factual mistakes and have provided supporting links whenever I can. The links are all from public sources links, which shouldn't contain virus (certainly not any coronavirus). If you spot anything wrong, please leave a comment below, and I will try to edit it out.

 

About the author: college senior in mathematics, Chinese national, a guy who should probably be doing the Courant video or preparing for the ICME interview but instead here to talk about stuff that kills people.



The Chinese people have been celebrating the Lunar new year for thousands of years, during which time they gather to have a family feast and give small little red paper pocket with money to their kids. There are not many things that can stop a Chinese person from going home during the Lunar new year to enjoy herself, but the recent coronavirus outbreak certainly does the trick. If not hospitalized (10,000~100,000), quarantined (I don't know) or grounded (census population 58,000,000), this Chinese person is probably worrying about the virus and has probably watched the videos of multiple Wuhan (the city with the largest infection number) doctors [yelling ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K16x3xcCK-c)or [crying](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrWhbiAH4uU), which at least scared the hell out of me. 

 

If you have been reading this and do not know me personally, you are then probably not Chinese, and you probably don't hand out small little red paper pocket to kids. You are probably not particularly concerned about the current outbreak in China, and I or other Chinese people going into full survival mentality is probably a non-story to you. Normally I usually wouldn't mind the apathy, and most of the time I would strongly advise so for the sake of emotional health. Yet, unfortunately, (as of Jan 26, 2019) the epidemic has gone global: There have been [three confirmed cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/26/world/china-coronavirus.html#link-5a43999b) in the US, one in Washington State and one in Chicago, the latest one in Orange County. The incredibly densely populated [Singapore has four confirmed cases](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/4th-confirmed-case-of-wuhan-pneumonia-virus-in-singapore-moh-12339912), and it certainly does not help that [the first confirmed patient had been travelling for two days, accompanied by his family](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/first-case-of-coronavirus-found-in-singapore/1711654). One noteworthy confirmed case is in France (three cases so far), where a [Wuhan resident had shown symptoms prior to departure, yet lied on the virus check and went on to a Michelin-starred restaurant](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2020/01/24/ire-chinese-woman-cheated-coronavirus-checks-fly-france-michelin/). Other countries with confirmed cases include Thailand (5 cases), Australia (4 cases), Malaysia (4 cases), Japan (3 cases), South Korea (3 cases), etc. 

 

These all happened in a matter of a few days, and the situation will likely intensify due to the following factors: 

- (a) China has a large population, many of whom could fly to other countries and may or may not be infected;
- (b) Even if they are infected, the symptom might not show for two days to fourteen days (this period of time is commonly referred to as the incubation period); 
- (c) This coronavirus spreads quite quickly. In two weeks, the confirmed cases spread from around fifty to over two thousand in China; 
- (d) Among the two thousand confirmed cases, there have been forty deaths, which gives an estimated 2% case-fatality-rate. 

 

I would personally characterize the China novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as a common cold that kills, which is probably among the worst possible word combination that one can think of. As an example, the 1918 pandemic, commonly known as the Spanish flu, has a case-fatality-rate of about 3% in the United States and also spreads quite quickly. Globally there were 500 million infected and 50-100 million killed.

 

Experienced readers will be quick to realize that up to this point I have caused potential worry by comparing this new disease with the dreadful Spanish flu in the absence of solid quantification of one serious factor: I did not quantify how fast each disease spreads. Actual statisticians have long resolved this ambiguity by coming up with simplifying statistical models to estimate the spread of diseases and to quantify what fast means. Disease transmission models are of utmost importance in letting the public know how worried they should be and in informing the government of the demand for hospital equipment needed in the long run. What we have is a live cautionary tale on how important a reliable model is, both for China as a whole and for the world at large. The Wuhan people, on the whole, did not understand the seriousness of the novel coronavirus until the whole city [is in complete lockdown](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/china-restricts-travel-for-35-million-people-to-halt-spread-of-deadly-virus/2020/01/24/80086bde-3ee4-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html). The Wuhan government proclaimed to have sufficient medical equipment to contain the outbreak, and yet their supply in key items such as protective clothing, goggles and protective masks are [tragically insufficient](https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/25/china/wuhan-coronavirus-update-intl-hnk/index.html), [leading to many doctors infected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-wuhans-virus-wards-plenty-of-stress-but-shortages-of-everything-else/2020/01/24/ba1c70f0-3ebb-11ea-afe2-090eb37b60b1_story.html). 

 

Yet, in terms of media and public attention in China, apart from [direct estimation](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mrc-global-infectious-disease-analysis/news--wuhan-coronavirus/) in the spirit of guestimating [how many aliens are out there](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Fermi_paradox), the only relevant prediction model to been seen as of now is the SIR model and its variations, such as the preprints [1] (see [coverage in *Wired*](https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-predict-wuhans-outbreak-will-get-much-worse/)), [2] (an extremely incompetent model with unreasonably redundant structure, yet a good example of what an actual calculation looks like). Both of the publications use the more general SEIR model taking the incubation period into account. The more basic SIR model is also found in tabloids giving the prediction that [the disease will die out in early May](https://www.dwnews.com/全球/60165950/德教授用SARS参数推演武汉肺炎疫情结束时间5月上旬).

 

As of more accessible sources, it has been suggested by [an analysis](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/H6kOqojXWZ_2ToH1YahAtA) (derived also from the SEIR model, though derivation is not open-source) in the media outlet that the novel coronavirus can be controlled since the novel coronavirus' [basic reproduction number](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Basic_reproduction_number) is close to that of the SARS coronavirus, which is supposed to calm the public since the Chinese successfully controlled SARS [with about 5,000 people in total being infected](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome#/History). More daringly, in the article, the result in [1] was used to make a guarantee to the public that the disease can be controlled despite the recent apparent chaos and [laughable incompetence](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-governor/chinese-provincial-press-conference-on-coronavirus-inspires-anger-criticism-idUSKBN1ZP0RU). The uplifting tone is all the more confusing, given the fact that an optimistic outlook is not at all what the report [1] painted, though we will leave it at that and trash this analysis a bit later.

 

As acknowledged by the authors of [1] in the [coverage in *Wired*](https://www.wired.com/story/scientists-predict-wuhans-outbreak-will-get-much-worse/), as of now, the prediction they made was shaky. There are several reasons why the model in [1] possibly gives the wrong prediction, but most of the possible criticisms can be equally applied to other mathematical models, which is usually variants of the saying "the generalization/assumptions made in this model is unrealistic". In the particular case of the use of SEIR model in the transmission model of 2019-nCoV, there are several issues that could be pointed out, such as

- The SEIR model does not take into account of age/sex difference (for example confirmed records of deaths from novel coronavirus [are mostly elderly men](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/23/world/asia/coronavirus-victims-wuhan.html))
- Interregional migration hasn't been considered (more on that later)
- Death in the infected population hasn't been taken into account. 
- As confirmed by officials, [people who show no clear symptoms (in the incubation period of infection) could be contagious](https://www.sciencealert.com/wuhan-coronavirus-can-be-infectious-before-people-show-symptoms-official-claims). 

 

However, these concerns are less effective arguments on the predictive power of the model and can be countered by more or less the saying that "all models are wrong but some are useful." We have to understand that predictive models of this kind are not completed if we simply state the assumptions without having some parameters. For example, the SIR model assumes that every day a fixed certain proportion (i.e., x%) of the infected & contagious population will be treated, going from the I (**I**nfectious) of SIR to the R (**R**ecovered) of SIR, but it's not clear how big the fixed proportion (the x%) is. Some people may kill me for saying this, but in such a model (almost) all we care about is to predict how much people will have been infected some certain time duration further into the picture. All we care about, then, is a function that takes time (how many days/hours from now on) as input, and outputs some number of people (how many are infected the inputted time from now on).

 

I'll be fine with it as long as it predicts pretty accurately within some time period. I don't care if there is a model that is grossly overgeneralizing or lacks explanatory power, or just plain wrong.  Moreover, addressing the assumption issues mentioned above is mainly about making alterations to the system of partial differential equations which you wanted to write. For this particular instance, the derivation of the equations, as well as its alterations, are quite easy conceptually, though implementing some of the refined assumptions could be prohibitively hard computationally. For example, interregional migration makes the computation much more tedious to carry out since there the cities would then be coupled.

 

However, it's not clear that the result will have more explanatory or predictive power with more realistic assumptions built-in. For example, letting people who do not show symptoms be contagious may be similar to boosting the infection possibility of those who are modelled as infectious & contagious. These two different models are basically similar in the equations you write, and these two models will all be fitted by doing regression according to the data of confirmed cases. I do not think the difference will be big for a more accurately assumed model, and I will think of these criticisms as more of the pedestrian kind. With good regression, the prediction is likely to go wrong significantly only further into the future, but I am happy to see an actual calculation play out. 

 

The more worrying criticism is voiced by one sentence ["garbage in, garbage out"](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Garbage_in,_garbage_out) (with a catchy acronym GIGO). This is a commonly used phrase in the machine learning community, meaning that if you feed your model misleading data to do statistical regression, then you will probably fail at letting the model complete whatever task it's supposed to do, be it classification, prediction, or data generation. And unfortunately, a completely unusable data set what is happening right now in Wuhan, and in the short term, it will stay an unresolvable impossibility (more on that later). 

 

Now, if you understand my explanation of GIGO, you will know that for the research community outside it is impossible to get a good model with good data being handed to them. Otherwise, they will be writing fiction instead of academic paper, and not a very great one at that. The predominant issue is that the key unknown data needed to pick the right parameters (e.g. how large a proportion is treated) is the number of confirmed cases at each city per day, but, as I will show you shortly, confirmation data is wrong beyond recognition. People who show symptoms in Wuhan (the largest infection zone) and neighbour regions cannot be easily confirmed. 

 

To illustrate we will take a look at the practical side of case confirmation. The procedure of case confirmation takes two days as of Jan 24 (from semi-official Chinese news outlet Wenhuibao/Beijing News, report [here](http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/24/679052.html)). Resolving delay in confirmation due to this factor seems to be quite easy: you just take whatever people that are confirmed in day x, and move that data to day x-2. The more severe issue is that to confirm a case you need to use diagnosis kit (试剂盒), whose supply is sufficient for now ([daily production is enough for 100,000 people and is probably growing](http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/24/679052.html)), but the bottleneck is the fact that doctors need to insert this kit into a PCR machine to make the diagnosis, and due to government orders the test can only be done in government-approved labs. 

 

If there is one thing that college taught me a great deal and I wish other people talk about more often, that thing would be the difference between linear and non-linear events. Disease grows non-linearly (in the near term possibly exponentially, or very fastly if you like), but the capacity of labs to make confirmation is limited by physical constraints, the most obvious one being how many PCR machine there are. There are countless recent posts on Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter) saying that their relatives show severe symptoms but can not receive confirmation but were told that the hospital does not have diagnosis kits (I do not think the posts I mention will be alive if my article ever gets attention. One supporting evidence is in SCMP [here](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3047613/china-coronavirus-wuhan-residents-describe-doomsday-scenes)). Lack of diagnosis kits is possibly untrue since one person can carry kits worth of several thousands of diagnoses. Though saying the hospital is out of kits probably attracts more sympathy from the patient than telling the patients the hospital does not have PCR or the hospital does have PCR but they cannot operate in the hospital's own machine.

 

Before Jan 24, [the ceiling for the capacity of confirmation is 200 per day in the Hubei](http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/24/679052.html), which is the whole province containing Wuhan (the province has five times the population of Wuhan). The [capacity is scheduled to grow to 2,000](http://www.bjnews.com.cn/news/2020/01/24/679052.html) shortly by opening up new labs, but this number is still far less than the number of people hospitalized or waiting to be hospitalized, and furthermore potentially a large number of people who do not show symptoms simply cannot have their case confirmed. An equally important issue is that the date of confirmation will be totally corrupted data by the delay in the confirmation capacity. This situation can be resolved with a proper self-report form of when the patients show the symptom, but that may not be available to researchers on the grounds of national security, and it will be the best-case scenario if such a conflict ever occurs.

 

Adding to the layer of difficulty in obtaining data, the Hubei Province has about 58,000,000 people, which is five times the population of its provincial capital Wuhan, and yet due to the dire situation in Wuhan, it also attracts the most media attention and most of the resources. The lack of case confirmation situation is likely to intensify as the infected population grows (possibly exponentially) in other cities of Hubei. The mostly under-discussed four-fifths of the Hubei is likely to have a delay or lack of confirmation more than Wuhan by a big margin. Granted, a statistical model can give parameters to how quickly each city confirms patients, but the city [QianJiang(潜江) with a million population still has no confirmed cases, only patients with symptoms but are told the hospital has no diagnosis kits](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/FvKZD99AA1SsyPHsQO6hsA). In this extreme case, if you fit parameters using SIR model, all predictions will be that there will be no new cases. This situation is in the SIR model is called no disease equilibrium. The predictive power of models without the interregional effect and no reliable data will have zero predictive power and possibly misleading the government's attention in terms of disease control, the biggest risk being another tragic outbreak.

 

I had written a fairly clear comprehensive introduction to the SIR or SEIR model, giving all the necessary assumptions needed to make the model yourself at home (no parents guidance needed) and I was going to tell you all about it like a proper nerd will do, that is, until I finished writing all the points in the previous paragraph. As you read the reports, the chant of GIGO will only be louder, until it explodes in your head into a million pieces of horror and despair in statistics hell (which is also [about the not incorrect number of protective masks manufactured in Hubei](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-governor/chinese-provincial-press-conference-on-coronavirus-inspires-anger-criticism-idUSKBN1ZP0RU).) To have a correct model, you need to take into effect the possibility of intentional or unintentional withholding data of the relevant party, and correct disease transmission model probably need to be corroborated by a much wider source of information, such as Chinese social media record (Web crawler + NLP), satellite data (CV + well, a satellite), and whatever data that you weren't supposed to get and I probably wasn't supposed to talk about. A model with actual insight is more probably from online investigators in platforms such as [bellingcat](https://www.bellingcat.com/) than one described by some system of partial differential equations (the SIR model uses the simpler special case of a system of linear ordinary equations, unsurprisingly [born at around 1920s](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Compartmental_models_in_epidemiology), which is still the dark ages of computational science and [women were the computers](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Women_in_computing#/1920s).), and without proper data or some ways of dealing with data corruption, I'll possibly continue to yell GIGO to everyone that would listen. 

 

With the absence of good data from China, the worst-case scenario for some variation of the SIR or SEIR model with parameter chosen by data fitting to have a reasonably accurate prediction could be done by properly recording the infection number of some other country. This is nothing new: statistical models usually need more data points to have a smaller confidence interval, and if you have a corrupted data source and possibly unfixable, then you should probably need to find another source. But in this particular case, the so-called more data points involves putting people's lives at risk, and anyone who looks at the data, generates some SIR model and begin to say that people are safe are complete idiots: catastrophes in complex networks with tight coupling cannot be mitigated always have a possibility of escalation (play Plague Inc if you have some time, or read [Normal Accidents](https://www.amazon.com/Normal-Accidents-Living-High-Risk-Technologies/dp/0691004129) by Charles Perrow if you have a lot of time. If not, google the Spanish flu which isn't that long ago), and with the infection number in China being this high, any possibility of total outbreak, even as low as 0.1%, should be avoided at all costs. 

 

Panic for a bit. Then stock up. Then check your country's equivalent of CDC. But do remember the limitations of the statistical models and try not to be put to ease by them without checking first or asking someone to check if it's a stupid model or not. I will be happy to leave it at that. But we have been only talking about the making of models, it is when it comes to the interpretation of models that the story takes a yet darker turn. 

 

The point of models such as SIR is not only to predict how many people will be infected by some disease and gauging how much one should be worried, but it is also a vital tool in analyzing how interventions could be made and how effective the measures will be. For example, quite famously the proportion of people that need to be vaccinated to prevent an outbreak is estimated by the use of basic reproduction number. There is an [article](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/H6kOqojXWZ_2ToH1YahAtA) attracting quite large attention in the Chinese media, titled (roughly translated) *the basic reproduction number of novel coronavirus is similar to that of SARS and is preventable and controllable* ("周涛：武汉肺炎基本再生数与 SARS 接近，确属可防可控的传染病"). In it, the author claimed that there is an aerodynamic equation for the calculation of the basic reproduction number, which is the infection possibility multiplied by the number of people a person meets each day and the length of time that a disease lasts. The author further went on to claim that, basic reproduction number can decrease to one-fourth of 4.0 if people see only a tenth of the people they usually meet. From a grim estimate of 4.0 in [1] for the basic reproduction number, the author claim that this method will decrease the basic reproduction number to lower than one, at which point we can lower the rate to one so we shouldn't worry that much.

 

This kind of bullshit work is what I worry about most in the absence of a good model, but I'll first show you why it is total dross. There is certainly an arcane academic objection that this is *not at all* how the basic reproduction number is calculated (which usually involves some data fitting hard to explain in the pedestrian sense). Be that as it may, a simpler answer is that this equation itself is stupid on many levels for a start, one of them being that the term infection possibility (传染率 in the original article) is not static. For example, if you stay at home and meet only a handful of people, then you stay with them an incredible amount of time and they are very possible to be infected by you. Apart from the family infection, people who go to the hospital for a common cold (whose symptom such as coughing, sneezing, low-degree fever is similar to that of novel-coronavirus during the incubation period) may also get novel coronavirus from cross-infection, especially [when the hospital is overpopulated](https://www.businessinsider.com/footage-hospital-coronavirus-treatment-wuhan-on-lockdown-2020-1) and the general public have a shortage of supply of effective protection such as goggles (obvious from all pictures) or [clean protection masks](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-health-governor/chinese-provincial-press-conference-on-coronavirus-inspires-anger-criticism-idUSKBN1ZP0RU). They can be infected if at any time they touch their faces with unwashed hands. It's very likely that there is some sort of lower bound on how stopping going to see other people altogether lowers the basic reproduction number, but the exact number or a reliable estimation is simply not there.

 

Moreover, the basic reproduction number makes a huge qualitative transition when it crosses the threshold of one, which determines if the disease will die out or spread to a population. The basic reproduction number simply cannot be interpreted and stretched this way without proper academic support, especially when it's not certain well above one.  I am happy to know that I am wrong or maybe the claim has empirical support of some kind, but at this stage, I do believe this to be wishful thinking at its best. As of now, 60,000 clicks have been placed on this article, and I am sorry for any one of them who believe what the author said or even went on to spread the word around like doctrine. Sadly it's another case of people taking scientism as science, taking equations for truth. I'll hate to know if anyone lowers prevention level because of this article. 

 

This is the way things are going to be. The situation will only get worse if no solid model is made. Arrogant rogue statisticians will go on to provide models like these for those who like a scientific touch for their chicken soup for the mind, which I am afraid will contribute to increasing the basic reproduction number rather than the other way around. Having placed that bet, I want to say for the record that whether superstition spreads or controls disease is irrelevant. I do not think there is a so-called best amount of panic for the public for the purpose of disease control, and I would further argue that the public is better served if they know to panic at around three weeks earlier on Jan 1, 2020, at which time there is already lots of attention from the national health department and media (see a chronological account [here](https://mp.weixin.qq/), titled "武汉疫情瞒报之谜：来自爬虫和文本分析的证据"). I would further argue that people's lives are at serious risk, and they are supposed to judge for themselves on the risk by professional work done with care and good data. Interpretations of anything short of that are irresponsible sciences stupefying people into agreement with every word they ever see, believing so long as equations are written and tables drawn. I'm optimistic. We have been through catastrophes and plagues and things always keep getting better. I believe that there is nothing more dangerous than misplaced belief, a baseless optimism that is so bright that it obscures this simple fact: things will always move on and get better, and life, by which I mean us, will always find a way, but I or you or everyone you know or everyone I know may not be alive to see it.
